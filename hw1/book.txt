One day the old man says to his wife "Please, bake me a bun". The old woman takes some flour, some sour cream, some butter and some water, and makes a bun. She puts it on the windowsill to cool.
But the bun cannot sit on the windowsill! It jumps from the windowsill to the bench, from the bench to the floor, from the floor to the door, and runs away.
The bun runs along the road and meets a hare. "Little bun, little bun, I want to eat you!" says the hare. "I ran away from Grandfather, I ran away from Grandmother. And I can run away from you, little hare!" says the bun and runs away.
The bun runs along the road and meets a wolf. "Little bun, little bun, I want to eat you!" says the wolf. "I ran away from Grandfather, I ran away from Grandmother, I ran away from the hare. And I can run away from you, grey wolf!" says the bun and runs away.
The bun runs along the road and meets a bear. "Little bun, little bun, I want to eat you!" says the bear. "I ran away from Grandfather, I ran away from Grandmother, I ran away from the hare, I ran away from the wolf. And I can run away from you, big bear!" says the bun again and runs away.
The bun runs along the road and meets a fox. "Little bun, little bun, I want to eat you!" says the fox. "I ran away from Grandfather, I ran away from Grandmother, I ran away from the hare, I ran away from the wolf, I ran away from the bear. And I can run away from you, old fox!"
"What a nice song!" says the fox. "But little bun, I'm old and I cannot hear you well. Sit on my nose and sing your song again." The bun jumps on the fox's nose and... the fox eats it!
